### Georgia Institute of Technology 
• Developed model to automated highway maintenance. 
• Leverage convoluted neural network using Keras to automatically process drone images to detect areas with mowed grass and areas with unmowed grass, as well damage signs or pavements. 
• Obtained average F1 score of 98%, average precision of 99%, and average recall of 96% 
• In collaboration with and funded by the Georgia Department of Transportation. 
• Technologies used: UAVs, Python, Keras, OpenCV, C++, CloudCompare, MeshLab. 

### Georgia Institute of Technology
